Alright to start the server of my program run a command line argument giving the number of players per session

an example of this would be 

java MemoryGameServer -num 2

this would open a server allowing only two players per session.

To run the client, you simply just run the java file.

“java MemoryGameClient”

however there are some command line options I included such as:
-help		:	this displays the instructions on how to play the game
-server	:	this displays the servers ip address which is used to connect to it
-img		: 	this displays the directory of where the images are kept

that’s pretty much it, if you run the server without a command line argument, it just keeps running threads over and over again. So it’s probably in your best interest not to do that.
